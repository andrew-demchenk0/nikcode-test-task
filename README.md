# DealYoop - React Application. Test task

This project is a React application built using TypeScript, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Formik, and Axios. It consists of two main pages: the Home page and the Profile page, with routing between them. The Home page displays a list of offers fetched from the API, while the Profile page features a sidebar navigation and a user data form with Formik validation.
